# Patentic - A Blockchain-Based Platform for Patent Registration and Management

Patentic is a decentralized platform for patent registration and management on the blockchain. It enables inventors and creators to protect their intellectual property and monetize their patents in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner. The platform leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide a decentralized, immutable, and auditable database of patents, making it easier for inventors to prove ownership, enforce their patents, and license their inventions.
Patentic is built on the Polygon network, enabling fast and affordable transactions for users. With Patentic, you can easily create and manage your patents without the need for third-party intermediaries or expensive bureaucratic processes.

## HOW IT WORKS
* Connect your Polygon wallet on the landing page
* Click on the "Create Patent" button to begin the patent creation process
* Fill in the patent details, including the patent name, content, and category
* Click "Create" to finalize the patent creation process. You will be prompted to exchange 0.02 MATIC for 0.02 PAT tokens. Once you sign the transaction, the exchange will be complete.

## FEATURES

### VIEWING PATENTS
After creating a patent, users can view their patents on the "Accounts" page. Here, they can see a list of all the patents they have created, along with their details such as the patent name, content, time, and owner.

### EXPLORING PATENTS
Users can also explore patents created by other users on the "Explore/Patents" page. Here, they can browse through patents created by other users on the platform. Clicking on a specific patent will reveal its details, such as the patent name, content, time, and owner.

### MESSAGING PATENT OWNERS
In addition to exploring patents, users can also communicate with patent owners over the blockchain. By clicking on the designated button on a specific patent, users can send messages to the patent owner.
